# Father’s Day Interactive Madlibs Website — Specification Document

### Overview  
A playful and sentimental interactive madlibs web app celebrating a first Father’s Day, designed as a simple, elegant single-page experience optimized for desktop (2015 MacBook Pro). The user fills in all inputs at once, then sees a digital slideshow reveal with themed sections, pre-selected photos, and a heartfelt closing screen.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Flow  
- Landing page shows a single form with all madlibs input fields visible at once.  
- Each input field has a clear label with a playful prompt/clue (e.g., “A silly adjective,” “Your favorite food”).  
- Form requires all fields to be filled before submission (validation).  
- Upon submission, user is presented with a slideshow-style reveal of madlibs sections one by one.  
- Each slideshow page displays a themed madlib section paired with a pre-selected photo.  
- Navigation controls: “Next” and “Back” buttons to move through sections at user pace.  
- After last madlibs section, a separate special screen shows a final message:  
  **“I love you dad! <3 Nolan”**  
- No data persistence or user accounts; all state handled client-side.  
- No social sharing, no music, no print layout required.

### 2. Themed Sections  
- 3 to 5 short, humorous madlibs sections, plus a final sentimental section.  
- Section themes example: “Dad the Athlete,” “Dad the Dog Dad,” “Dad the DJ,” “Dad the Dr Seuss Reader.”  
- Pre-selected photos (provided as assets) accompany each section.  
- Madlibs inputs collected in one form, no section grouping visible to user to preserve surprise.

### 3. Input Fields  
- Simple text input boxes with descriptive labels/prompts for each required part of speech or phrase.  
- All inputs required — form cannot submit until all fields are filled.  
- No placeholders or additional input styling beyond labels and basic boxes.

### 4. Reveal Experience  
- Slideshow with Next/Back navigation buttons.  
- No auto-advance, no animations or fancy transitions on first version (straightforward and simple).  
- Consistent playful, colorful woodland nursery theme styling applied across both form and reveal pages.  
- Final message shown on separate screen after madlibs sections.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Target Platform  
- Desktop-first (2015 MacBook Pro)  
- No immediate responsive/mobile layout required; future improvements possible.

### 2. Visual Style  
- Playful, colorful with woodland creatures nursery theme.  
- Use readable handwritten-style font.  
- Maintain cohesive styling across all screens.

### 3. Performance  
- Fully client-side with minimal dependencies to keep load time low and interaction smooth.

## Architecture & Technology Choices

### Frontend  
- **Framework:** React or Vanilla JS + HTML/CSS (developer’s choice, React recommended for component structure and state management)  
- **State:** All inputs and slideshow state stored in component/local state; no backend or database.  
- **Styling:** CSS Modules, Styled Components, or plain CSS — enough to implement playful woodland nursery theme with color and font choices.  
- **Assets:** Photos preloaded or imported as static assets, mapped to each themed section.

---

## Data Handling

- Inputs collected from form stored client-side only during session.  
- No backend storage or authentication.  
- All madlib text rendered dynamically into predefined templates for each section on reveal.  
- Validation on client side to ensure all fields completed before submission.

---

## Error Handling

- Prevent form submission if any input is blank.  
- Show clear error message or highlight missing fields.  
- Slideshow navigation should prevent going past first or last page.  
- Handle unexpected errors gracefully with fallback UI or message.

---

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests  
- Validate input fields accept and store values correctly.  
- Test validation logic to ensure form requires all fields before enabling submit.  
- Confirm slideshow navigation buttons enable/disable appropriately at edges.  
- Verify final message screen appears after last section.

### Integration Tests  
- Full form input to slideshow reveal flow with various input data sets.  
- Image and text rendering correctness per themed section.  
- Responsiveness to user navigation controls.

### Manual Testing  
- Verify appearance on 2015 MacBook Pro screen resolution and browser (Chrome latest).  
- Confirm stylistic consistency between input form and reveal pages.  
- Check accessibility basics (focus states on inputs and buttons, keyboard navigation).
